A woman like you is precious and hard to find. Wishing you a day as beautiful as you are!
You are a special woman and I want you to know how very important you are. Have a wonderful day!
Don't walk into a room full of people and wonder if they like you. Look around and wonder if YOU like them!

Without you the heart feels empty,
Let the world blossom with your smile
